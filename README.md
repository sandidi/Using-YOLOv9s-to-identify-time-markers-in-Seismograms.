# Using YOLOv9s to Identify Time Markers in Seismograms

## Introduction
This project uses the YOLOv9s model to identify time markers in seismograms.

## Requirements
- ultralytics-8.2.60

## Installation
You can install ultralytics-8.2.60 from the official address:
<[official address](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/tree/v8.2.60)>

## Model
Our trained v9s model is available in the folder, named best.pt.

## Usage
